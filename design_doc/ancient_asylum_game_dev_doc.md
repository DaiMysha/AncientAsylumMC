**Ancient Asylum

Base concept**

A ruined area where robots patrol, disposing of any threat they find.

A threat is someone who dealt damage within its operation area
Deep inside, there is a Mother Brain. Tempering with it will send it haywire and robots will be endlessly dispatched.
After killing a certain number of robots, the Mother Brain explodes and gives you an item to have your own personal robots


**Content information**

A new biome will be added to world generation

This biome will have a corrupted/desolate look.

In this biome, only specific mobs will be able to spawn (ie corrupted variants of zombies)
Underground, the proper Ruins will spawn.

On the surface, trees will be replaced with Synthetic Trees. They do not have a sapling variant.

Mining them gives Synthetic Wood (which can be used like normal wood)
However, uptting Synthetic Wood in a furnace produces Synthetic Rubber instead.

From Synthetic rubber, you can make different items, including a Growth Chamber.

This Growth Chamber allows you to place saplings (or synthetic rubber) and obtain Tree capsules.

Using Tree capsules on a valid growth tile will immediately spawn a full tree, including synthetic trees.

Using synthetic rubber, you can also make different production facilities (TBD).

These allow you to produce a bunch of different blocks that can be used for aesthetics purposes, but also to craft your own combat robot, much like they were in the ruins.

A new improved shield will also be available to craft.

**Workload per person**

**Rylen:** World generation, all cosmetic blocks

**Lilia:** AI, all production and crafting chains

**Details**

3 types of robots:

\- Surveillance robot, cannot be interacted with and follows the player once it gets inside of the Mother Brain’s area. If the player it’s attached to isn’t a threat or suspicious, it slowly heals them (equivalent to natural regeneration at high hunger)

\- Combat robot, acts much like metroids. Nigh-invulnerable until the Mother Brain is tempered with

\- Disposal robot. Only active if the Mother Brain isn’t tempered with. Automatically grabs and destroys any dropped item in the area.

Naturally-generated Ruin wall blocks (with some exceptions) cannot be mined until their corresponding Mother Brain has been destroyed. They can afterwards.

Almost every block should be renewable in some capacity.

Ruin wall blocks need to be based on iron in some capacity.

Disposal robots carry items to a specific area, where a giant industrial door that opens is.
